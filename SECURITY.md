# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project sees improvements and fixes on a rolling basis.
This means that when a critical security issue is identified the patch rolls out in a later version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have encountered what you believe to be a security issue in this project, please report it via the Issues tab.
Mark it as a security issue by applying the label :label: Security to the issue during or after creation.
The team will prioritize that in the development cycle.
